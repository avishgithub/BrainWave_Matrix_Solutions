This repository features two MySQL database projects built with MySQL Workbench: a Library Management System (LibraryDB) and an Online Store (OnlineStoreDB). The Library Management System handles books, members, borrowings, and fines, while the Online Store manages customers, products, orders, and payments. Both projects include sample data and SQL queries to showcase efficient database design and operations.
